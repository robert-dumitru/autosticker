# Autosticker

This repository contains the code for the Autosticker telegram bot, which generates completions for sticker packs based
on the original stickers.

## Usage

Send a link to the sticker pack (this should be a link of the format https://t.me/addstickers/...) - the bot will send 
back sticker completions in about 30 seconds.

## Installation

If you want to deploy your own instance of this bot, the easiest way is via Railway:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/JTCuYw?referralCode=ifVnil)

Follow the instructions on the deployment page and input the required API tokens. You may also host the bot locally by 
building the docker container and running it with the same API tokens.

Contributions are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
